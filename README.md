# Shiny for Python - DEPRECATED!!

We renamed this extension from `Posit.shiny-python` to `Posit.shiny`. If you previously used the old extension, upgrading to the latest version will automatically install the new extension and prompt you to uninstall the outdated version.

New Shiny users should install the [Shiny extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Posit.shiny) instead of this one.
